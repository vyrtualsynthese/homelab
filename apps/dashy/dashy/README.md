## Getting Started 🛫

> For full setup instructions, see: [**Deployment**](./docs/deployment.md)

### Deploying from Docker Hub 🐳

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system

```
docker run -p 8080:80 lissy93/dashy
```

Or

```docker
docker run -d \
  -p 4000:80 \
  -v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml \
  --name my-dashboard \
  --restart=always \
  lissy93/dashy:latest
```
[![Dashy on Docker Hub](https://dockeri.co/image/lissy93/dashy)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/dashy)

If you prefer to use Docker Compose, [here is an example](./docs/deployment.md#using-docker-compose).

Dashy is also available through GHCR, run: `docker pull ghcr.io/lissy93/dashy`.

To use Dashy on an system other than `amd64`, then use [one of these tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/dashy/tags). There are containers for `arm32-7`, `arm64-v8` and a multi-architecture image.

The image defaults to `:latest`, but you can instead specify a specific version, e.g. `docker pull lissy93/dashy:release-1.5.0`

> Once you've got Dashy running, you can take a look at [App Management Docs](./docs/management.md), for info on using health checks, provisioning assets, configuring web servers, securing your app, logs, performance and more.

### Deploying from Source 🚀

You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), the latest or LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and (optionally) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.

- Get Code: `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy.git` and `cd dashy`
- Configuration: Fill in you're settings in `./public/conf.yml`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build: `yarn build`
- Run: `yarn start`

> See docs [Full list of Dashy's commands](./docs/management.md#basic-commands)

## Configuring 🔧

> For full configuration documentation, see: [**Configuring**](./docs/configuring.md)

All of Dashy's configuration is specified in a single [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, located at `./public/conf.yml`. You can find a complete list of available options in th [Configuring Docs](/docs/configuring.md). If you're using Docker, you'll probably want to pass this file in as a Docker volume (e.g. `-v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml`).

The config can also be edited directly through the UI, with changes written to your conf.yml file. After making any modifications the app needs to be rebuilt, which will happen automatically or can be trigger with `yarn build` or directly through the UI.

You can check that your config is valid and matches Dashy's [schema](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/ConfigSchema.json), by running: `yarn validate-config`.

Finally, you may find these [example config](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10) helpful for getting you started.

## Theming 🎨

> For full theming documentation, see: [**Theming**](./docs/theming.md)

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://i.ibb.co/BVSHV1v/dashy-themes-slideshow.gif">
    <img alt="Example Themes" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/theme-slideshow.gif" width="400" />
  </a>
</p>

Dashy comes with a number of built-in themes, but it's also easy to make you're own. You can either use the color editor, or you're own custom CSS. All colors, and most other CSS properties are specified using CSS variables, which are [documented here](./docs/theming.md#css-variables), so customizing the look and feel of Dashy very easy. Learn more about adding your own theme in the [docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/theming.md#adding-your-own-theme).

<p align="center">

## Icons 🧸

> For full iconography documentation, see: [**Icons**](./docs/icons.md)

Both sections and items can have an icon associated with them, and defined under the `icon` attribute. There are many options for icons, including Font Awesome support, automatic fetching from favicon, emojis, programmatically generated icons and direct local or remote URLs.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/GTVmZnc/dashy-example-icons.png" />
</p>

- **Favicon**: Set `icon: favicon` to fetch a services icon automatically from the URL of the corresponding application
- **Font-Awesome**: To use any font-awesome icon, specify the category, followed by the icon name, e.g. `fas fa-rocket` or `fab fa-monero`. You can also use Pro icons if you have a license key, just set it under `appConfig.fontAwesomeKey`
- **Simple Icons**: Use any brand/ logo icon from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/) by setting the icon to `si-[icon-name]`
- **Emoji**: Use an emoji as a tile icon, by putting the emoji's code as the icon attribute. Emojis can be specified either as emojis (`🚀`), unicode (`'U+1F680'`) or shortcode (`':rocket:'`)
- **Generative**: Setting `icon: generative`, will generate a unique logo for a given service, based on it's specified URL or IP
- **URL**: You can also pass in a URL to an icon asset, hosted either locally or using any CDN service. E.g. `icon: https://i.ibb.co/710B3Yc/space-invader-x256.png`
- **Local Image**: To use a local image, store it in `./public/item-icons/` (or create a volume in Docker: `-v /local/image/directory:/app/public/item-icons/`) , and reference it by name and extension - e.g. set `icon: image.png` to use `./public/item-icon/image.png`. You can also use sub-folders here
- **Material Design Icons**: You can also use any icon from [materialdesignicons.com](https://dev.materialdesignicons.com/icons) by setting the icon to `mdi-[icon-name]`

## Status Indicators 🚦

> For full monitoring documentation, see: [**Status Indicators**](./docs/status-indicators.md)

Dashy has an optional feature that can display a small icon next to each of your running services, indicating it's current status. This is useful if you are using Dashy as your homelab's start page, as it gives you an overview of the health of each of your running services. Hovering over the indicator will show additional information, including average response time and an error message for services which are down.

By default, this feature is off, but you can enable it globally by setting `appConfig.statusCheck: true`, or enable/ disable it for an individual item, with `item[n].statusCheck`. 

You can also specify an time interval in seconds under `appConfig.statusCheckInterval`, between checks, if this value is `0`, then status is only checked on initial page load, which is the default behavior. Status checks use the `url` attribute, but to call a different endpoint instead, you can set `statusCheckUrl`. Custom headers can also be specified using `statusCheckHeaders`.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Status Checks demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/status-check-demo.gif" width="600" />

## Authentication 💂

> For full authentication documentation, see: [**Authentication**](./docs/authentication.md)

Dashy now has full support for secure single-sign-on using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)! This provides secure, easy single-sign on. See [setup docs](/docs/authentication.md#keycloak) for a full usage guide

There is also a simple login feature for basic access control, which doesn't require any additional setup. To enable this feature, add an `auth` attribute under `appConfig`, containing an array of `users`, each with a username, SHA-256 hashed password and optional user type.

```yaml
appConfig:
  auth:
    users:
    - user: alicia
      hash: 4D1E58C90B3B94BCAD9848ECCACD6D2A8C9FBC5CA913304BBA5CDEAB36FEEFA3
      type: admin
```

**Guest Access**: By default, when authentication is configured no user can access your dashboard without first logging in. If you would like to allow for read-only access by unauthenticated users, then you can enable guest mode, by setting `appConfig.auth.enableGuestAccess: true`.

**Granular Controls**: With basic login, it is also possible to control which sections are visible to which users. Under the `displayData` property of a section, you can pass an array of usernames to  one of the following attributes:
- `hideForUsers` - Section will be visible to all users, except for those specified in this list
- `showForUsers` - Section will be hidden from all users, except for those specified in this list
- `hideForGuests` - Section will be visible for all logged in users, but not for guests (if guest access is enabled)

<p align="center">
  <img
    title="Example login screen, using Vapourwave theme"
    alt="Example login screen, using Vapourwave theme"
    src="https://i.ibb.co/K52YL1g/dashy-login-form.png"
    width="400"
  />
</p>

**Note**: The simple auth method handles access control on the frontend, and therefore in security-critical situations, it is recommended to use an alternate method for authentication, like [Keycloak](docs/authentication.md#keycloak) or one of the [alternatives](docs/authentication.md#alternative-authentication-methods).

## Opening Methods 🖱️

> For full documentation on views and opening methods, see: [**Alternate Views**](./docs/alternate-views.md)

One of the primary purposes of Dashy is to make launching commonly used apps and services as quick as possible. To aid in this, there are several different options on how items can be opened. You can configure your preference by setting the `target` property of any item, to one of the following values:
- `sametab` - The app will be launched in the current tab
- `newtab` - The app will be launched in a new tab
- `modal` - Launch app in a resizable/ movable popup modal on the current page
- `workspace` - Changes to Workspace view, and launches app

Even if the target is not set (or is set to `sametab`), you can still launch any given app in an alternative method: Alt + Click will open the modal, and Ctrl + Click will open in a new tab. You can also right-click on any item to see all options (as seen in the screenshot below). This custom context menu can be disabled by setting `appConfig.disableContextMenu: true`.

In the workspace view, you can keep previously opened websites/ apps open in the background, by setting `appConfig.enableMultiTasking: true`. This comes at the cost of performance, but does mean that your session with each app is preserved, enabling you to quickly switch between your apps.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://i.ibb.co/vmZdSRt/dashy-context-menu-2.png" />
</p>

The modal and workspace views work by rendering the target application in an iframe. If you are getting a a `Refused to Connect` error, then you need to set the HTTP response header [`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) to `ALLOW [url-for-dashy]`. See [the docs](./docs/troubleshooting.md#refused-to-connect-in-modal-or-workspace-view) for instructions on how to do this.

---

## Alternate Views 👓

As well as the default homepage, there is also:
- A minimal view, useful for use as a browser start page
- A workspace view, useful for visiting many apps simultaneously

You can change the view from the UI, using the switch icon in the top-right corner, or select a default view in the config, under `appConfig.startingView` attribute (can be either `default`, `minimal` or `workspace`). Clicking the page title on any view will take you back to your default starting view.

<p align="center">
  <b>Example of Workspace View</b><br>
  <img alt="Workspace view demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/workspace-demo.gif" width="600" />

## Searching and Shortcuts 🔎

> For full documentation on searching, see: [**Searching & Shortcuts**](./docs/searching.md)

Quickly finding and launching applications is the primary aim of Dashy. To that end instant search and customizable keyboard shortcuts are built-in.

To start filtering, just start typing. No need to select the search bar or use any special key. You can then use either the tab key or arrow keys to select and move between results, and hit enter to launch the currently selected application. You can also use `Alt + Enter` on a selected app to launch it in a popup modal, `Ctrl + Enter` to open in new tab, or right-click on it to see all opening methods.

You can also add custom tags to a given item, to make finding them based on keywords easier. For example, in the following example, searching for 'Movies' will show 'Plex'

```yaml
  items:
  - title: Plex
    description: Media library
    icon: favicon
    url: https://plex.lab.local
    tags: [ movies, videos, music ]
```

For apps that you use regularly, you can set a custom keybinding. Use the `hotkey` parameter on a certain item to specify a numeric key, between `0 - 9`. You can then launch that app, by just pressing that key, which is very useful for services you use frequently.

Example:

```yaml
- title: Bookstack
  icon: far fa-books
  url: https://bookstack.local/
  hotkey: 8
```

To search the web directly through Dashy, just press enter after typing your query. Options for web search are set under `appConfig.webSearch`. There is built in support for [10+ search engines](./docs/searching.md#setting-search-engine), or [use your own custom provider](./docs/searching.md#using-custom-search-engine) or self-hosted instance.
To disable web search all together, set: `webSearch: { disableWebSearch: true }`

```yaml
webSearch:
  searchEngine: duckduckgo
  openingMethod: newtab
```

With the web search, you can also define your own bangs, to redirect results to any given app, website or search engine, when the query is preceded with a certain character sequence (usually beginning in `/`, `!` or `:`).

For example, with the below code, typing `:git dashy` will search GitHub for Dashy, or `/w docker` will open the Docker Wikipedia page. 

```yaml
webSearch:
  searchBangs:
    /r: reddit
    /w: wikipedia
    /s: https://whoogle.local/search?q=
    ':wolf': wolframalpha
    ':so': stackoverflow
    ':git': github
```

Hit `Esc` at anytime to close any open apps, clear the search field, or hide any modals.

## Config Editor ⚙️
> For full config documentation, see: [**Configuring**](./docs/configuring.md)

From the Settings Menu in Dashy, you can download, backup, edit and rest your config. The editor will tell you if you've got any validation warnings.

A full list of available config options can be found [here](./docs/configuring.md). It's recommend to make a backup of your configuration, as you can then restore it into a new instance of Dashy, without having to set it up again. [json2yaml](https://www.json2yaml.com/) is very useful for converting between YAML to JSON and visa versa.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Config Editor demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/config-editor-demo.gif" width="600" />
</p>

**Update:** A new and improved drag-and-drop UI editor is in progress, and should be released within the next couple of weeks!

**[⬆️ Back to Top](#dashy)**

## Cloud Backup & Sync ☁

> For full backup documentation, see: [**Cloud Backup & Sync**](./docs/backup-restore.md)

Dashy has an **optional** built-in feature for securely backing up your config to a hosted cloud service, and then restoring it on another instance. This feature is totally optional, and if you do not enable it, then Dashy will not make any external network requests.

This is useful not only for backing up your configuration off-site, but it also enables Dashy to be used without having write a YAML config file, and in the future there will allow the use of the public hosted instance of Dashy for users without a server.

All data is fully E2E encrypted before being sent to the backend. In Dashy, this is done in [`CloudBackup.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/CloudBackup.js), using [crypto.js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)'s AES method, with the users chosen password as the key. The data is then sent to a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works), and stored in a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works) data store.

## Language Switching 🌎
> For full internationalization documentation, see: [**Multi-Language Support**](./docs/multi-language-support.md)

Dashy supports multiple languages and locales. When available, you're language should be automatically detected and applied on load, based on your browser or systems settings. But you can also select a language through the UI (under Config --> Switch Language), or set `appConfig.language` to your language (specified as a 2-digit [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)).

#### Supported Languages
- 🇬🇧 **English**: `en` - _Default_
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese**: `cn` - Contributed by **[@FormatToday](https://github.com/FormatToday)**

- 🇦🇪 **Arabic**: `ar` - Contributed by Anon
- 🇮🇳 **Hindi**: `hi` - Contributed by Anon
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese**: `ja` - Contributed by Anon

#### Add your Language
I would love for Dashy to be available to everyone, without language being a barrier to entry for non-native English speakers. If you have a few minutes to sapir, you're help with translating it would be very much appreciated.
It's quite a quick task, all text is in [a single JSON file](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/src/assets/locales), and you don't have to translate it all. For more info, see the [Adding a New Language Docs](./docs/multi-language-support.md#adding-a-new-language), and feel free to reach out if you need any support.

## Setting Dashboard Info 🌳

Page settings are defined under [`pageInfo`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#pageinfo). Here you can set things like title, sub-title, navigation links, footer text, etc. For example:

```yaml
pageInfo:
  title: Home Lab
  description: Dashy
  navLinks:

## Developing 🧱

> For full development documentation, see: [**Developing**](./docs/developing.md)

[![Open Project in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in-VS_Code-863cfc?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://open.vscode.dev/Lissy93/Dashy)

Before getting started, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and optionally [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (run `npm i -g yarn`) installed.

To set up the development environment:
1. Get Code: `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy.git`  and `cd dashy`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn`
3. Start dev server: `yarn dev`

Hot reload is enabled, so changes will be automatically detected, compiled and refreshed.

Like most Git repos, we are following the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) standard.
1. Create a branch (or fork if you're not a collaborator)
2. Code some awesome stuff, then add and commit your changes
3. Create a Pull Request, complete the checklist and ensure the build succeeds
4. Follow up with any reviews on your code
5. Merge 🎉

Branch names are specified in the following format: `[TYPE]/[TICKET]_[TITLE]`. E.g. `FEATURE/420_Awesome-feature` or `FIX/690_login-server-error`.

Most commit messages use git [commit emojis](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a) - e.g. ✨ = New feature, 🐛 = Bug fix, 💄 = UI stuff, 🚧 = Work in progress, 🌐 = Language, 🔖 = New release, and so on. Take a look at [gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev/) for a list of what each emoji indicates

Before you submit your pull request, please ensure you've checked off all the boxes in the template. For your PR to be merged, it must:
- Must be backwards compatible
- Any new features should be documented
- The build, lint and tests (run by GH actions) should all pass (there are some exceptions)
- There must not be any merge conflicts

If you're new to web development, I've put together a short [list of resources](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/developing.md#resources-for-beginners), to help beginners get started

## Release Schedule 🗞️

> For full release, automation and CI documentation, see: [**Releases & Workflows**](./docs/release-workflow.md)

Dashy is under active development, with features, improvements and changes pushed almost daily.

We're using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), to indicate major, minor and patch versions. You can find the current version number in the readme, and check your apps version under the config menu. The version number is pulled from the [package.json](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/package.json#L3) file.

Typically there is a new major release every 2 weeks, usually on Sunday, and you can view these under the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/releases). Each release will create a new [tag on GitHub](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tags), and each major release will also result in the creation of a new [tag on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/dashy/tags), so that you can fix your container to a certain version.

For a full breakdown of each change, you can view the [Changelog](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md). Each new feature or significant change needs to be submitted through a pull request, which makes it easy to review and track these changes, and roll back if needed.
